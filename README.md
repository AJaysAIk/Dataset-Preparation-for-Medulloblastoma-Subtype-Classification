# Dataset-Preparation-for-Medulloblastoma-Subtype-Classification
Medulloblastoma constitutes the single largest group of malignant brain tumours in kids, making up nearly 20% of all paediatric central nervous system tumours [1]
Back in 2012, the international community decided to go with the four main molecular subgroups WNT, SHH, Group 3, and Group 4 which are different in terms of the transcriptomic, epigenomic, and clinical characteristics.

Recently, Sharma et al. [1] carried out a comprehensive meta, analysis of DNA methylation data from 1, 501 Group 3/Group 4 tumours and came up with eight well, defined subtypes (Types IVIII) within these subgroups.

Each of these subtypes is characterised by distinct driver gene changes, cytogenetic alterations, and survival rates, thus precise subtyping is of considerable clinical significance for risk stratification and treatment decision, making.
